## Content :memo:

All posts are written in Markdown and live in the `content` directory.

## Theme

The website uses an [Hugo Future Imperfect Slim](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim) theme for Hugo. It's installed as a git submodule and lives in the `themes` directory.

## Customization

Custom CSS can be found in `static/css`.

## Running locally :computer:

`hugo server -D` for local preview.

## TODO

### Priority
- sort out favicon
- setting up Netlify (project, github hooks)
- add at least 2 posts


### Nice to have
