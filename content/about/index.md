We are a community of women working in the field of technology in the Czech Republic. Our collective goes beyond the borders of programming languages, tech stacks or job descriptions.

Among us you will find seniors and juniors; web developers, cybersecurity experts, QAs, project and product managers, designers, site reliability engineers, event and community managers, and more.

We speak Python, Ruby, Javascript, C++, Java, Golang, and SQL among others. We look at the world through multiple lenses of our diverse backgrounds and experiences. We’re there for each other creating a space in which every member feels confident asking hard questions, seeking advice, and offering to share their knowledge and experience. And we work tirelessly to bring visibility to the excellent work of women working in tech, shedding light on those trailblazers who are making it easier for others to follow in their footsteps.

Our passion for technology brings us together to create a space in which we can make new friends, find mentors and role models, laugh at geeky jokes and learn from each other.
